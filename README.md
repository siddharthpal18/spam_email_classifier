Spam-Ham Email Classifier
Project Overview
The Spam-Ham Email Classifier is an advanced machine learning application designed to accurately distinguish between spam (unwanted email) and ham (legitimate email). This project uses Python and Flask for web deployment, making it easily accessible via a browser. It leverages a robust set of machine learning tools and techniques, including pre-trained embeddings from the GloVe model, and is backed by a SQLite database for efficient data handling.

Project Structure
app.py: Flask application for deploying the model on a web server.
glove.txt: GloVe file containing pre-trained word embeddings used for text data vectorization.
label_encoder.pkl: Pickled file of the LabelEncoder, used to transform text labels into a suitable format for model training.
model.pkl: Serialized version of the trained machine learning model ready for predictions.
my_data.db: SQLite database file containing the processed email data.
project.py: Core machine learning script that includes data preprocessing, training the model, and evaluating performance.
requirements.txt: List of Python packages required to run the project.
spam.csv: Dataset file containing the spam and ham email messages.
vectorizer.pkl: Pickled file of the CountVectorizer, used to convert text data into a format that can be used by the model.
Installation Instructions
Prerequisites
Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-ham-classifier.git
cd spam-ham-classifier
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source env/bin/activate  # On Unix or MacOS
Install dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the Flask Application
To launch the Flask web application:

Copy code
python app.py
This command starts a web server that hosts the classifier. Access the application via http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

Using the Classifier
Navigate to the web application and follow the on-screen instructions to input an email text and receive a classification result.
